License Tiers (locked)
1. Personal

Who it’s for

Solo devs
Students
Indie builders

Rules

1 user
1 active device/session
Personal or limited commercial use
No redistribution
No team sharing

Enforcement

Bound to one user account
Download + device limits enforced

2. Commercial

For small businesses and client work when a single person is doing the work.

Rules

1 user
Single company or freelancer usage
Client deliverables are allowed, but no resale or redistribution of the product itself
No team sharing

Enforcement

Bound to one user account
Download + device limits enforced

3. Team

Team = small, defined, capped.

Rules

2–5 users max (hard cap)
Internal team use only
Seats must be explicitly assigned
No resale, no redistribution
Shared within one org / repo / product

What happens at 6 users?

They cannot buy Team
They are told to contact you → Enterprise
No silent upgrades. No auto scaling.

Why 5 is the right cap

Big enough for:
Startup teams
Student groups
Small agencies

Small enough that:
You don’t underprice real org usage
Enforcement stays simple
Enterprise still has meaning

This is the line in the sand.

4. Enterprise

Not a plan. A conversation.

Rules

6+ users OR
Redistribution OR
White-label OR
Client-facing tooling OR
Institutional use (school, company, NGO, etc.)

How it works

No checkout
No price shown
Manual approval
Manual license creation

UI copy

“For teams larger than 5 or special use cases, contact me.”

That’s it.

Pricing Logic (important mindset)

Do not price per seat beyond Team.
That’s how you accidentally build Stripe.

Instead:
Personal → fixed price
Commercial → higher fixed price
Team → higher fixed price (covers up to 5)
Enterprise → negotiated

If they need 20 seats, that’s not “4× Team”.
That’s Enterprise.

How this maps cleanly to your system

You already have:
Licenses
Downloads
Audits
Abuse detection

License types in the system:
PERSONAL
COMMERCIAL
TEAM

Enterprise is handled manually (custom contract + manual license rules).

Team seat rules:
Personal → maxSeats = 1
Commercial → maxSeats = 1
Team → maxSeats = 5
Enterprise → custom rules

Everything else stays the same.

Compliance + enforcement

Licenses are non-transferable.
No resale, redistribution, or public sharing.
Audit logs record license actions, downloads, and abuse signals.
Abuse or license sharing can trigger license suspension or termination.

Download + device limits are enforced to prevent abuse.

Copy you can use everywhere (short + confident)

Team license
“For small teams of up to 5 people.”

Enterprise
“For teams larger than 5 or special use cases. Contact for access.”

No apology. No explanation.
