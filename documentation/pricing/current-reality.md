# CURRENT REALITY

## Purpose
Document the current, honest state of pricing, products, and services so we do not overpromise.

## Current Stage
Hybrid portfolio + shop + services with manual operations and strict boundaries.

## What Is Live Right Now
- Portfolio site and digital products with manual payment confirmation.
- Cash-only digital product checkout with license issuance after confirmation.
- Credits-based services with manual scoping and approvals.

## Pricing Reality
- Public pricing is directional for services and support buckets.
- Enterprise pricing is not public; it is quote-only via contact.
- One-off cash payments are still allowed for services.

## Credits Reality
- Credits are prepaid service units, not money, not hours.
- Credits are applied to scoped work only; scope changes cost extra.
- Internal valuation is used for scoping; no public $/credit display.

## Payments & Automation Reality
- Payments and refunds are handled manually.
- Webhooks, automated invoicing, and admin tooling are not complete.
- Verification and approvals happen by email or direct contact.

## What Is Explicitly Not Ready Yet
- Automated student verification or instant discounts.
- Real-time credit tracking for clients without manual review.
- Self-serve enterprise onboarding or custom contracts.

## Decision Authority & Flexibility
Founder approval is required for scope, pricing exceptions, and timeline changes.

## Anchor Principle
Be clear, be strict, and only promise what the current system can deliver.
